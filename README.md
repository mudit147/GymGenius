### Commit Notation

type(scope): subject

Here's the breakdown of each part:

Type: Describes the purpose or category of the commit. It can be one of the following:

feat: A new feature or enhancement.
fix: A bug fix.
docs: Documentation-related changes.
style: Code style/formatting changes (e.g., whitespace, formatting).
refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
test: Adding or modifying tests.
chore: Other changes that do not modify code (e.g., build scripts, configuration files).
Scope (optional): Indicates the specific component, module, or area of the codebase that the commit affects. It helps provide additional context. Not all commits require a scope.

Subject: A concise description of the change. It should be written in the imperative present tense and provide a high-level overview of what the commit does.

Here are a few examples of commit messages using this notation:

feat(user-auth): Add password reset functionality
fix(api): Fix issue with null pointer exception in data processing
docs(readme): Update installation instructions
style(components): Format code according to style guidelines
test(api): Add unit tests for user service
chore(build): Update dependencies and build scripts
